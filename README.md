# Computer Architecture Lab

This repository contains the code and resources for the Computer Architecture Lab course project.

## Introduction
CA-LAB1400 is a project for the Computer Architecture Lab course at the University of Tehran. The goal of the project is to implement a pipelined MIPS processor with a set of instructions and memory hierarchy, including a cache and a memory controller.

## Architecture
The architecture of the processor includes a set of stages, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write back. The pipeline is implemented using a series of registers that hold the data between stages.

The memory hierarchy includes a cache and a memory controller, which manage the flow of data between the processor and main memory.
